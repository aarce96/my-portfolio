            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <!-- Paragraph about me -->
            <p>
                My name is Arturo Arce, and I am a native New Yorker. 
                Football is something that I cannot live without, it was first sparked by my discovery of the Spanish club, Real Madrid, in my early teenage years that pushed me to pursue the sport. 
                It was the clubâ€™s grandeur at that time that attracted me to the team but, it has since shifted to their perseverance, especially in this past season. 
                The club was not seen as a legitimate contender for the UEFA Champions League cup and faced criticism from a multitude of football analysts, many of whom are retired players. 
                Despite this common sentiment the team was still able to go the distance and win. Their will to hold on, and improve is what makes me want to support them. 
                As well as to go through my own life with the same attitude of assessing weakness and striving to overcome them.
